# A Pseudo-100 Days of Code

Insipired by the various "100 Days of Code" challenges, the
"Advent of Code" challenge, and the concept of "Daily Pages",
I've created a personal created a pseudo-"100 Days of Code".

## Goals

Break out of "tutorial hell"
Code a little bit (almost) every day
Flesh out the Python coding environment

## Morning Pages

***“The bedrock tool of a creative recovery is a daily practice called Morning Pages.”***

Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning. *There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages*– they are not high art. They are not even “writing.” They are about anything and everything that crosses your mind– and they are for your eyes only. Morning Pages provoke, clarify, comfort, cajole, prioritize and synchronize the day at hand. Do not over-think Morning Pages: just put three pages of anything on the page...and then do three more pages tomorrow.
